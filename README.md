<h3>🚀 Features: </h3>

✅ PDF Summarizer: Extracts key insights from uploaded PDFs using chunked processing with transformer models.

✅ Stylized Image Filters: Converts uploaded images into Ghibli-style art and pencil sketch effects using OpenCV.

✅ FastAPI Backend: Handles file uploads, AI inference, and returns responses as JSON/Base64.

✅ Real-Time UX: Optimized frontend with dynamic content hiding, loading states, and styled outputs.

✅ Error Handling: Resilient backend with validation, file-type checks, and detailed feedback.

<h3>🛠️ Tech Stack </h3>

Frontend: React.js (Context API, Hooks)

Backend: FastAPI, Python

AI/ML: Hugging Face Transformers, OpenCV

Others: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, FormData API

<br/>

<h3>🧠 How It Works: </h3>

<h5>PDF Summary: </h5>

Upload PDF → Chunked text extraction → Summarization using transformer → Output summary

<h5>Image Stylization: </h5>

Upload image → Resize and preprocess → Apply Ghibli/Sketch filter with OpenCV → Return base64 image

</br>

<h3>📈 Key Outcomes: </h3>

📊 Improved PDF summarization speed by ~40% through chunked inference and async processing.

🎨 Delivered real-time stylized images for improved UX responsiveness and engagement.

🔗 Seamlessly integrated Hugging Face models and custom CV pipelines into one web suite.
